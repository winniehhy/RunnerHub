<h3>Runner Hub Website </h3>
<p>Welcome to the repository for our Runner Hub website project! This repository contains the source code for a school project webpage for a fictional runner club. The webpage incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic experience. In this project, we aim to create a webpage for our runner club where visitors can explore and purchase shoes for men, women, and kids, featuring different brands and colors. Additionally, the webpage will showcase promotions, latest activities, and sales. Users will have the option to sign up for our club's information through the website.</p>
